Available only in JPEG format. It \nprovides the following options: \n\u2022 \nBaseline (Standard): Displays the image when it has fully downloaded. This \nJPEG format is recognizable to most web browsers. \n\u2022 \nBaseline (Optimized): Optimizes color quality of the image and produces \nsmaller file sizes but is not supported by all web browsers. \n\u2022 \nProgressive (3 scans-5 scans): Downloads the image first as a low-resolution \nimage, with incremental quality improvements as downloading continues. \n \nColor management \nRGB/CMYK/Grayscale \nSpecifies the type of color management to be applied to the output file and whether to \nembed an ICC profile. \nNote:  \nIf you use the Export To or Export All Images command on a PDF that contains JPEG and \nJPEG 2000 images, and export the content to JPEG or JPEG 2000 format, the resulting image \nmay look different when opened in Acrobat. This can happen if the images have a color \nprofile included at the page level but not inside the image data. In this case, Acrobat cannot \nbring the page-level color profile into the resulting saved image. \n \nConversion \nColorspace/Resolution \nSpecifies a color space and resolution for the output file. You can let Acrobat determine these \nsettings automatically. To convert color images in the file to shades of gray, choose Grayscale. \nNote:  \nHigher resolutions, such as 2400 pixels per inch (ppi), are suitable only for small page sizes \n(up to 6.826 inches or 173.380 millimeters). \nPDF to PNG conversion settings \nIn Acrobat, select All tools > Export a PDF and select Image format.

Adam7 creates an image that displays low-resolution versions \nin a browser while the full image file is downloading. Adam7 can make downloading time \nseem shorter and assures viewers that downloading is in progress; however, it increases file \nsize. \nFilter: Lets you select a filtering algorithm. \n\u2022 \nNone: Compresses the image without a filter. Recommended for indexed-color \nand Bitmap-mode images. \n\u2022 \nSub: Optimizes the compression of images with even horizontal patterns or blends. \n\u2022 \nUp: Optimizes the compression of images with even vertical patterns. \n\u2022 \nAverage: Optimizes the compression of low-level noise by averaging the color values \nof adjacent pixels. \n\u2022 \nPaeth: Optimizes the compression of low-level noise by reassigning adjacent color \nvalues. \n\u2022 \nAdaptive: Applies the filtering algorithm\u2014Sub, Up, Average, or Paeth\u2014best suited for \nthe image.
